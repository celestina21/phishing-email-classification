        "The scope of this project and therefore the dataset falls under **Phishing**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Phishing is a type of cyberattack that utilises social engineering to manipulate targets into desired actions such as revealing sensitive information, downloading malware, etc. This is often executed via emails, text messages and phone calls where attackers impersonate trusted individuals like the authorities to deceive targets, tricking them into the desired action.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its simplicity  compared to other cyberattacks like zero-day exploits, its appeal to human psychology make phishing attacks dangerously effective (with the median time taken for targets to fall for phishing emails being under 60 seconds according to the [2024 Verizon DBIR](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf)), hence their popularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on phishing via email as it is a highly popular method of phishing. According to the [2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report](https://cofense.com/getmedia/db5a5ad7-b39a-45f5-bab7-eb165b9a0685/2024-cofense-annual-state-of-email-security-report.pdf), 91% of published cyber threat reports began with phishing. Moreover, [the 2024 Verizon DBIR states that 94% of malware is delivered via email attachments](https://hoxhunt.com/guide/phishing-trends-report#key-phishing-statistics-for-2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Email phishing is often used in:\n",
        "- Bulk email phishing\n",
        "  - Attackers indiscriminately send emails to as many people as possible to capture as many targets as possible.\n",
        "- Spear phishing\n",
        "  - A targeted attacked where victims are primarily those with access to sensitive data or authority that can be exploited.\n",
        "- Business email compromise (BEC)\n",
        "  - A subset of spear phishing targeting business organisations with the intention of stealing money or intel such as trade secrets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recently, the mainstream usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT models via platforms like ChatGPT make phishing emails easier to generate for attackers. For instance, attackers may prompt these LLMs for tailored emails in perfect grammar, punctuation and spelling, getting rid of language errors that used to be a key flag in detecting phishing emails. These LLMs can generate various and decently realistic emails quickly based on prompt quality, allowing phishing operations to grow quicker than before. According to IBM's X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, it would take an attacker 16 hours to manually come up with a phishing email, but with artificial intelligence such as LLMs, they can create more convincing emails in five minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Still, one of the main defences against phishing include email filters utilising Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify phishing emails as they come and segregate them to a folder such as 'spam', based on existing data of phishing emails. It is a fast, automated approach that can be kept up to date as the algorithms get fine-tuned on newer phishing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project will produce either a ML or Deep Learning (DL) model using a phishing email dataset to mimic real-life email filters and later experiment with attacks against and defenses for the model under the \"Evade ML Model\" technique of the MITRE ATLAS framework, specifically where adversarial  data is crafted to mislead email filters into believing a phishing email is safe in order to bypass filters and enter the target's view."

        "The dataset \"[Phishing Emails Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails)\" by subhajournal on Kaggle is a collection of email body content extracted from emails to help the detection of phishing emails via text analysis and classification using ML.\n",
        "\n",
        "It contains 18,600 emails labelled either as \"Safe Email\" or \"Phishing Email\". Most are safe emails as is the case in the real world where phishing attempts-- while increasingly common--represent a fraction of the vast volume of normal emails sent daily.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset has been used in academic studies, such as in papers:\n",
        "- \"Robust Email Phishing Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach\" by Fares et al.\n",
        "- \"An Explainable Transformer-based Model for Phishing Email Detection: A Large Language Model Approach\" by Uddin and Sarker\n",
        "- \"Machine Learning Approach for Email Phishing Detection\" by Fares et al.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its popularity and adoption in these papers is for its:\n",
        "- diversty of emails.\n",
        "- decent sample size.\n",
        "- specialisation towards phishing detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, this dataset was chosen as it could serve as a decently realistic but controlled sample set for real-world emails, which is good for exploring the practical defense against ML model evasion of phishing detectors like email filtering systems."

        "# Models To Experiment With\n",
        "### Machine Learning (ML)\n",
        "1. Logistic Regression\n",
        "  - Logistic regression is chosen as a simple baseline while itself potentially being an effective and interpretable phishing email detector.\n",
        "  - It is also efficient and commonly used for binary classification.\n",
        "2. Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)\n",
        "  - SVMs are chosen because it decides a hyperplane that best separates classes instead of modelling probabilities directly, which could make them more robust than Logistic Regression for text classification as it focuses more on separation than fitting to a distribution.\n",
        "  - LinearSVC specifically is used as it is effective for handling high dimensional data.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Later in Data Exploration And Preprocessing, feature generation and selection will be done to more explicitly capture text features since ML models usually work better with well-defined tabular data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Deep Learning (DL)\n",
        "3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
        "  - LSTMs are designed to capture long-term dependencies  and handle sequential data, making them well-suited for longer text data like emails.\n",
        "5. Pre-trained DeBERTa V3 XSmall\n",
        "  - DeBERTa is a transformer-based model that has been shown to excel at language understanding tasks, which could make it effective for phishing detection by understanding subtle phrasing cues in emails.\n",
        "  - DeBERTa specifically incorporates disentangled attention and relative position embeddings.\n",
        "    - With disentangled attention, it allows the model to understand both word meanings and the effects of a word's position on a sentence's meaning.\n",
        "    - With relative position embeddings, the model considers the distance between words rather than their absolute position.\n",
        "    - These enhancements potentially could improve accuracy in detecting phishing emails by better adapting to varying sentence structures and capturing more subtle cues.\n",
        "  - Utilising the pre-trained model which has been trained on vast and varied text such as Wikipedia and PENWEBTEXT (Reddit content) also makes it potentially robust, which is especially necessary when defending against adversarial  attacks during model evasion.\n",
        "  - The V3 XSmall version is used specifically as it is the smallest variant but offers a balance between performance and efficiency. It is necessary in the resource-limited scope of this project.\n",
        "   \n",
        "For DL models, feature generation will not be done as the models expect cleaned text as input and are capable of automatic feature learning. Potentially, the DL models may notice features neglected during feature generation for ML models."

Whether an email is HTML-formatted or not a very important indicator of phishing emails as genuine professional emails may be HTML-formatted, likewise phishing emails meant to mimic them. Ultimately, the tags are just noise and thus will be removed.\n",

        "4. Convert all text to lowercase\n",
        "  - Words that are actually the same will be treated as different according to the vectoriser if it has different capitalisation. To reduce dimensionality of the feature space after vectorisation, all text will be converted to lowercase so such words will be seen as similar.\n",
        "5. Tokenise the text\n",
        "  - Necessary for later steps.\n",
        "6. Remove non-alphabetical characters (punctuation, numbers, special characters)\n",
        "  - Presence of non-alphabetical characters are already captured in the proportion of non-alphabetical characters and frequency of exclamations features.\n",
        "7. Remove stopwords (except for phishing specific words like \"click\", \"now\", etc.)\n",
        "  - Stopwords usually don't add value.\n",
        "8. Lemmatisation\n",

This is exemplified in \"[A comparative study of deep learning models for sentiment analysis of social media texts](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3465/paper18.pdf#:~:text=Through%20experimentation%20on%20the%20IMDb,CNN%20attained%2087.03%25%20%2882.10)\" by Derbentsev et al. where it's shown that ML models like Logistic Regression did not perform as well as DL models even with GloVe embeddings used.\n",
